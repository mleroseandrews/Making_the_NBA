## Making_the_NBA
# Objective
Creating a model to predict whether a college basketball player will be drafted into the NBA.  We will be using data from drafted and undrafted players. Using machine learning we will perform logistical regression model and/or neural networks that will take and compile all the college data from 2009 to 2021 to predict which player will go to the NBA.   

# Hypothesis
We predict that the higher the average field goal percentage the more likely to be drafted into the NBA.

# Data Source
Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021
